        Elon Musk is a billionaire entrepreneur and business magnate known for pushing the boundaries of technology. He has been instrumental in the success of several high-profile technology companies, beginning with Zip2, a company he co-founded with his brother Kimbal Musk in the late 1990s, and PayPal, a payment system company that was later sold to eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002.

Musk is probably best known for his role as the CEO and lead designer of SpaceX, a private aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company. SpaceX (founded in 2002) has made significant strides in reducing the cost of space travel and advancing the goal of making life multiplanetary. Its Dragon spacecraft (launched in 2010) was the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to the International Space Station.

In addition to SpaceX, Musk leads several other groundbreaking ventures. He's the CEO of Tesla Inc., a company that specializes in electric vehicles and clean energy. Under Musk's leadership, Tesla (established in 2003) has become a leader in the auto industry, pushing for the mass-market adoption of electric vehicles.

Musk is also involved in projects that seem to come straight out of science fiction. He's the CEO of Neuralink (launched in 2016), a neurotechnology company that aims to integrate artificial intelligence with the human brain. He also launched The Boring Company in 2016 to address traffic congestion in major cities by creating a system of underground tunnels for transportation.

Most recently, Musk began buying shares of Twitter in 2022 and then ultimately bought out the company in October of that year. He became Twitter's new owner and CEO, taking the company private and firing many of its top executives. This began a period of tumultuous and controversial changes for the text-based social media company.

        Henry Ford introduced the Model T Ford automobile in October 1908, the world's first mass-produced car. In producing an automobile for the middle classes instead of just for the wealthy, Henry Ford help change American society forever.

        Prior to this Ford had spent many years perfecting different engines and models, including leaving an original company bearing his name that later became the Cadillac Automotive Company.
        
        The Model T went on to sell over 15 million units. Ford was able to achieve this by developing his car assembly line through mass production, the first significant industrialist to do so.
        
        Henry Ford is also remembered for establishing a minimum wage of $5 a day in 1914, raising the daily rate from $2.34 for most workers. It was a sensational move at the time aimed at acquiring and retaining the best workforce.
        
        In later life Henry Ford rested on his laurels and when he didn't adapt the Model T to customers wants he was overtaken by competitors before releasing the updated Model A in 1927.
        
        A man of often conflicting character, Ford is also remembered for his pacifism during World War I and his promotion of antisemitic views.

        <li><b>Birthplace:</b>  Modena, Italy</li>

       </ul>

       <p> 
        Enzo Ferrari was an Italian motor racing driver and entrepreneur, best known for founding the Scuderia Ferrari Grand Prix motor racing team and then the Ferrari automobile brand.

Ferrari began his automobile career as a test-driver for a car manufacturer that rebuilt secondhand truck bodies into small passenger cars. He managed to rise from this position to become a race car driver, making his competitive debut in 1919. He then joined Alfa Romeo in 1920, winning his first Grand Prix at Ravenna in 1923.

After the deaths of fellow drivers Ugo Sivocci and Antonio Ascari, and with the birth of his son Alfredo, Ferrari retired from racing and shift to management and development within Alfa Romeo. This position allowed him to build a team of drivers, including Giuseppe Campari and Tazio Nuvolari, with which he founded the Scuderia Ferrari team at Alfa Romeo.

Ferrari ultimately founded Ferrari S.p.A in 1947 after leaving Alfa Romeo and starting his own automobile parts company. He then took his new machines back to the racetrack, determined to compete against Alfa Romeo and Mercedes. Success came at least when José Froilán González won at Silverstone in 1951.
